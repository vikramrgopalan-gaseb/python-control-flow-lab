# Exercise 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure to handle any conversion errors gracefully.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Your control flow logic goes here

# Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()

def check_voting_eligibility():
    voting_age = 18
    
    try:
        # Prompt user and convert to integer
        age_input = input("Please enter your age: ")
        age = int(age_input)

        # Validate age is a possible value
        if age < 0:
            print("Age cannot be negative. Please enter a real age.")
        elif age >= voting_age:
            print(f"You are {age} years old. You are eligible to vote!")
        else:
            print(f"You are {age} years old. You are not eligible to vote yet.")
            
    except ValueError:
        # Handle cases where input is not a number
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number for your age.")

# Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()
